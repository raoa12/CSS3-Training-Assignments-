# CSS3-Training-Assignments-
Scenario 1:
Create a HTML page with the following specifications
a.	The web page will have two divs,  with width=500 and height=500
b.	Both the divs will have to have a dotted blue color border of 2 px.
c.	Inside both the divs, there would be 3 paragraphs
d.	First div will have a background color cyan and foreground color grey
e.	Second div will have a background color green and foreground color white
f.	The paragraphs sitting in the second div alone should have a background color magenta.
g.	Create appropriate CSS stylesheet as internal CSS


Scenario-2
a.	 Create a table which holds a list of 10 employee names in it.
b.	Apply zebra coloring/striping on it. (Zebra striping styling is where alternate rows of the table has different background colors. You can choose any background colors of your choice)

Scenario-3
a.	Create an unordered list of 10-20 employees with their employee names and  ids.  .   Eg1: Steve Martin-145130   Eg2: Ruth Jobs-133333
b.	We are planning for a surprise gift to all employees who have a character '5' in their employee ids. E.g.: Steve Martin-145130   
c.	Write appropriate CSS rules to show all the employees with the above criterion in “coral” background color and BOLD in the list so that they can be identified easily.

Scenario-4
a.	Create a Web Page with two horizontal sections – Header and Content
b.	In the header, have a heading for the Web Page – “A Tale of Two Cities” by Charles Dickens
c.	In the content section have a small paragraph giving some summary of this book (You can use any search engine to search for some content on this book)
d.	For both the heading and content, you need to use a non-standard font. 
e.	You can search for freely downloadable font format files like .woff / .ttf and use them for this scenario

(Hint: for this scenario, you can use the @font-face rule and apply it to the relevant elements)

Scenario-5

a.	A hotel chain is displaying some images on its web page displayed as a small thumb-nails/ icons.
b.	Original width and height of that image is just 100px and 100px each.
Requirement is that , when
a.	The user hovers over the image, the size of the image should be get gradually changed to 600px and 600px each so that the image is clearly visible to the user. 
b.	When the user comes out of the image, the image should go back to its original size of 100px and 100px each
(Hint: Use transition concept of CSS3 for this scenario)

Scenario-6
a.	Create a Web Page which has an animation running on it.
b.	Details of the animation are:
a.	As soon as the web-page loads and after a delay of about 5 seconds the animation can start, and the entire animation should take 10 seconds.
b.	The animation involves a circle that appears initially in the right-top corner of the screen with background color red  and next moves  to center of the screen with background color blue. Then it moves to right-bottom corner of the screen with background color red. Then it appears towards the left-top corner of the screen with background color green and next moves to center of the screen with background color blue. Then it moves to the left-bottom corner of the screen with background color green.
c.	This animation needs to keep running infinite number of times.
(Hint: Use animation related rules and properties to work on it)

Scenario-7

a.	Create a Web Page that has a div with many lines of content on it. Initially you can apply a height & width of 400px for this div.
b.	Center it to the screen and apply a green colored solid border of 2 pixel
c.	When the screen size goes below the max-width of 500px, the width of the div should become 200px and height should become 800px and apply a blue colored dashed border of 2 pixel.
d.	Also ensure that, in case of dimension change, the text within the div should not overflow but it should automatically come in newline instead of overflowing.

(Hint: Use media-queries for this scenario and use the CSS property word-wrap to ensure that the overflow of text does not happen)
